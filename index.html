    <p class="description">
        Hello! My name is John Mark Luslos, and I'm 20 years old. I live in Maligaya, Boac, Marinduque, and I'm currently studying Information Technology at Marinduque State College. I'm passionate about web designing and game designing, and I hope to contribute to society and the entertainment industry in the future. In my free time, I enjoy playing games on my mobile phone or console, watching anime series, and playing music with my guitar. I'm fueled by creativity and empowered by curiosity, and I believe in the power of collaboration and lifelong learning to create immersive experiences that can enrich both society and entertainment.
